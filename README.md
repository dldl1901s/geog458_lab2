## I've heard that Ireland and Great Britain are not on good terms with each other even though they are the same country. I wanted to crawl their tweets and see what was different from each other.

This is a Twitter map of Great Britain. Dots are concentrated in several major cities, including London and Manchester. The density of the dots decreases as it goes north, so Great Britain seems to be densely populated in the south, centering on London.

This is a Twitter map of Ireland. The density of points is very low compared to Great Britain. There are few dots located in the center of Ireland, but there are many dots gathered in Northern Ireland. The total population of Ireland seems to be significantly smaller than that of Great Britain. It seems that the population is concentrated in Northern Ireland.

This is the Great Britain word cloud. The "new" and "thank you" seem the biggest. There are many words that indicate action, such as 'see', 'look', 'go', and 'out'. I can feel people's dynamic activity from the words.

It is an Irish word cloud. The word 'now' was used the most. Words such as 'great' and 'new' seem to be used a lot. The feeling of the words as a whole is calm. The number of active words feels small. 

This difference seems to come from the difference in population between the two regions. The populous Great Britain region has more tweets and more active interactions. However, the sparsely populated area of Ireland has fewer tweets and the words used are far from active.
